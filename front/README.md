# Webjep

Webjep is an online Jeopardy platform for you to be able to play Jeopardy with your friends.
It comes with a helper page called Clue Builder to help you create and then save your clues into
JSON format.
Webjep supports online games with live WebRTC video between host and players, as well as a local
version where the game exists completely in your browser with no server communication. This is
useful for games where everyone is already in the room with you.
